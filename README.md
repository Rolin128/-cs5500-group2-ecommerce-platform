# Simplista: AI-Enhanced E-Commerce Platform

> A modern, Django-based e-commerce platform featuring AI-powered chatbot assistance, secure payment processing, and real-time inventory management.

## Part 1: Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already cloned the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rolin128/-cs5500-group2-ecommerce-platform
cd -cs5500-group2-ecommerce-platform
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

This API key is required for the chatbot functionality. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies isolated, follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

1. **Deactivate any existing virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   deactivate
   rm -rf venv
   ```

2. **Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.10:**

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **For macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **For Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

> **Note**: Ensure you use Python 3.10 specifically, as using a different version may lead to dependency issues. If you don't have Python 3.10 installed, refer to the documentation on how to download and install it.

### 4. Install Project Dependencies
Install the required packages from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create a Superuser
To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Default superuser credentials for development:
```
Username: test1126
Email: test1126@example.com
Password: H8MrR-Qu&50
```

> **Note**: These credentials are for development purposes only. In a production environment, always use secure, unique credentials.

### 6. Start the Development Server
Run the Django development server: 
This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this URL in your browser to view your project.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 7. Access Admin Panel Visit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with the superuser credentials to access Djangoâ€™s admin interface.
